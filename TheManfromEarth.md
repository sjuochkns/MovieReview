Movie: The Man from Earth

Review: The protagonist John Oldman is seen packing up to move when his colleagues show up to wish him good bye. His friends are worried about him moving in such a rush after 10 years of working together. John exclaims that it is just itchy feet, and that he doesn't like to stay put. Later he begins a conversation about what would it be like if he were actually 14,000 years old. This sparks a theological conversation among his peers asking questions and waiting for his responses, all while trying to refute his claim.
